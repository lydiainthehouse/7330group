"Number of persons are rounded to the nearest hundred.Figures in the table may not add up to the total due to rounding.For annual estimates less than 1 000 and quarterly estimates less than 3 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.Starting from 2001, annual figures are compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey from January to December of the year concerned as well as the mid-year population estimates.",,,,,,,,
1 Employed persons refer to those persons aged 15 and over who have been engaged in performing work for pay or profit during the 7 days before enumeration or who have had formal job attachment. Unpaid family workers and employed persons who were on leave/holiday during the 7 days before enumeration are included.,,,,,,,,
"2 Monthly employment earnings refer to earnings (before deduction of Mandatory Provident Fund contributions) from all jobs during the month before enumeration. For employees, they include wage and salary, bonus, commission, tips, housing allowance, overtime allowance, attendance allowance and other cash allowances. However, back pays are excluded. For employers and self-employed, they refer to amounts drawn from the self-owned enterprise for personal and household use. If information on the amounts drawn for personal and household use is not available, data on net earnings from business would be collected instead.",,,,,,,,
